    "# Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the moudle used to handle threads in python,\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans: Multithreading is a technique in Python that allows multiple threads (smaller units of a process) to run concurrently within a single process. This means that multiple operations can be performed at the same time, potentially improving the efficiency and performance of programs, especially when dealing with I/O-bound task\n",

    "# Improve Performance: Enables simultaneous task execution, ideal for I/O-bound operations like file handling and network communication.\n",
    "# Efficient Resource Utilization: Enhances system resource usage by overlapping I/O and computation.\n",
